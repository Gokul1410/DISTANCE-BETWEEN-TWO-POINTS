# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

### Step 2:
Get the 2 points from the user.

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 4: 
Print the distance.

### Step 5: 
End the program

import math

list1=[4,2]

list2=[10,6]

d=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)

print(f"{d:.2f}")
